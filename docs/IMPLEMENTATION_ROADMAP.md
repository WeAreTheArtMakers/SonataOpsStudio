## Week 3: Anomaly + Sonification
- tune anomaly thresholds and scoring
- enable audio render presets
- validate signed URL artifact flow

## Week 4: RAG Ingestion + Copilot
- onboard internal docs and taxonomy
- tune prompts/citations and prompt approvals
- run first groundedness/safety eval

## Week 5: Automations
- activate incident narrator

- test daily executive brief generation

## Week 6: UAT + Hand-off

## Competitive Landscape
- Traditional BI tools: strong visuals, weak workflow/context automation
- AIOps tools: strong alerts, weak executive narrative and explainability
- Generic AI copilots: strong language, weak grounding/governance by default
- SonataOps Studio: combines these layers with enterprise controls
